This is a basic project to find the "hourly wage" you are earning in high seas.
it is mostly meant as a fun visualizer and also a way to check the relative value of different items in the shop. 
you enter your average dubloons per hour, how many dubloons something would cost, and the dollar value of that item.
it will tell you the effective dollars per hour of that item.
